ORBTrace Hardware
=================

This is the repository for various hardware for the ORBTrace project. There are various bits and pieces here but the most important ones are;

* ORBTrace Mini V1.0
* ORBMule demo board
* Breakout board for PMOD

You can also find the openSCAD source materials, and vinyl graphics, for the ORBTrace Mini V1 case.

These materials are provided in open form to learn from and improve on. We have deliberately chosen to not provide Gerbers for ORBTrace mini or STLs for the caseworks since your manufacturing processes are likely different to ours. Drop a note if you need those.
